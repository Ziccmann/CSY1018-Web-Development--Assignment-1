                    <p>This purpose of this (Level 4) module is to give students an understanding of client side web
                        technologies. This module provides students with: the essential knowledge and practical skills
                        to design develop and implement a Web site to contenporary web standard; an overview of the
                        Internet technologies the overall software architecture of the Internet including servers
                        clients browsers is covered leading to the use of a Web server to install maintain and publish
                        Web Pages to achieve Web presence; standard client side dynamic web development environment such
                        as HTML Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript are covered in detail. </p>

                
                    <p>The module will introduce students to the Software Engineering lifecycle. Focusing on:
                        investigating a problem domain eliciting software requirements preparing a requirement
                        specification document performing system design and presenting them to clients; introduce
                        students to the skills principles and concepts necessary to implement solutions; use of a high
                        level programming language to implement algorithms; a late-objects approach will be adopted to
                

                
                    <p>This module provides basic knowledge of the hardware and software components that make up a
                        computer system. Modern computer systems not only consist of just the computer but also include
                        a range of peripherals. The module gives an overview of all the important concepts in
                        preparation for a deeper study of computer systems.Learning environments are offered to enable
                        students to gain a basic comprehension understanding and appreciation of computer system
                        concepts and technologies and the skills to use them to the best effect</p>
