                <p>04/16/2022</p>

                <p>For someone who didn’t code at all before entering the university, I will have to give myself an 8/10
                    with my current development as a coder and its all thanks to the good lecturers of the university of
                    Northampton. Especially Chris Rafferty who teaches us Web Development (CSY1018) and it might seem
                    like I am saying all this because this particular assignment was given to us by Chris himself but
                    it’s true, I still can’t believe I built a website all by myself in this short time. The key things
                    I learnt were how to correctly tag HTML code, where to use classes, how to properly separate CSS
                    codes from HTML codes, how to link CSS and HTML and how to debug.....
