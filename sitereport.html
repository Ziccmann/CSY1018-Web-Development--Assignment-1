                <h3>How I Made My First Portfolio Website</h3>

                <h5>Isaac Chukwubuike Samuel-Chukwudi</h5>
                <p>04/16/2022</p>


                <p>For someone who didn’t code at all before entering the university, I will have to give myself an 8/10
                    with my current development as a coder and its all thanks to the good lecturers of the university of
                    Northampton. Especially Chris Rafferty who teaches us Web Development (CSY1018) and it might seem
                    like I am saying all this because this particular assignment was given to us by Chris himself but
                    it’s true, I still can’t believe I built a website all by myself in this short time. The key things
                    I learnt were how to correctly tag HTML code, where to use classes, how to properly separate CSS
                    codes from HTML codes, how to link CSS and HTML and how to debug. I use the W3C markup validator to
                    debug my HTML and CSS code, I just simply copy and paste the code in W3C markup validator and it
                    traces all the bugs and errors in my code, it also tells me how to correct those errors and where
                    they are located. Right now, I can say that I am well acquainted with HTML and CSS. Though it wasn’t
                    always easy, I had some challenges along the way which is normal.
                </p>
                <p> Below are some of the challenges I went through will building the website with images included;</p>
                <p> <img class="sitereport-picture" src="Image/2022-04-12(3).png" alt="sitereport-picture">
                    <img class="sitereport-picture" src="Image/2022-04-12(1).png" alt="sitereport-picture">
                    <img class="sitereport-picture" src="Image/2022-04-13(1).png" alt="sitereport-picture">
                    <img class="sitereport-picture" src="Image/2022-04-13.png" alt="sitereport-picture">
                </p>

                <p>

                    In the first image, I had some issues committing my work to my GitHub, it almost took me a day to
                    sort that out but eventually I was able to sort it out. In the second image are errors that the
                    validator found in my code, I was able to locate them and fix all of them. In the last two images,
                    I was trying to put the hamburger icon in the mobile responsiveness but it kept appearing when I
                    click on the close bar and it should be the opposite. I checked several lines of my code to find the
                    issue which I did eventually and it worked.

                </p>

                <h4>My Website Mockups</h4>
                <p>Here are some of the mockups I did before I started working on the website;</p>
                <p>
                    <img class="sitereport-picture" src="Image/20220416_115653.jpg" alt="sitereport-picture">

                <h4>My Validation Report</h4>
                <p>Below are the validation reports of my HTML and CSS files, there are 7 in total;</p>
                <div class="validlist">
                    <p>1. Home page</p>
                    <p>2. Main CSS</p>
                    <p>3. Mobile CSS</p>
                    <p>4. Portfolio page</p>

                </p>

                <h4>Changes I Made Along The way</h4>
                <p>
                    Getting the right colors and designs to use was really hard and took a lot of my time but I
                    eventually found a decent color scheme and design I like, below are images of my first designs and
                    my current designs;
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    In conclusion, the was a really wonderful experience for me and I am happy I took this module
                    seriously. I also plan on updating this website with my future projects and growing my portfolio day
                    by day.
